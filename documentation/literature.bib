  abstract  = {The constant-pressure, constant-temperature (NPT) molecular   dynamics approach  is  re-examined  from  the  viewpoint  of  deriving  a  new  measure-preserving reversible geometric integrator for the equations of motion.   Theunderlying  concepts  of  non-Hamiltonian  phase-space  analysis,   measure-preserving  integrators  and  the symplectic  property  for Hamiltonian systems are briefly reviewed.  In addition, current measure-preserving schemes for the constant-volume,  constant-temperature  ensemble  are  also  reviewed.   A  new geometric integrator for the NPT method is presented,  is shown to preserve the correct phase-space volume element and is demonstrated to perform well in realistic examples.  Finally, a multiple time-step version of the integrator is presented for treating systems with motion on several time scales.},

Lennard–Jones diatomics with an embedded dipole moment and TIP4P/2005 water, are con-
sidered in extensive Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to systematically
study the differences in results caused by different treatments of the long-range electrostatic
interactions. In addition to the standard Ewald summation and reaction field methods, we
consider also two variants of short-range approximations. Both thermodynamic and struc-
tural properties, and both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases are considered. It is
shown that the accuracy of the short-range approximations with carefully selected parame-
ters may be sufficient for a number of applications; however, in some cases one can encoun-
ter accuracy limits or structural or other artifacts.},

  abstract  = {Characteristics of a population are  often unknown. To estimate such characteristics, random sampling must be used. Sampling  is  the  process  by  which  a  subgroup  of  a  population  is  examined  in  order  to  infer the  values  of  the  population's  true characteristics. Estimates based on samples are approximations of the population's true value; therefore, it is often useful to know the reliability of such estimates. Standard errors are measures of reliability of a given sample's descriptive statistics with respect to  the  population's  true  values.  This  article  reviews  some  widely  used  descriptive  statistics  as  well  as  their  standard  error estimators and their confidence intervals. The statistics discussed are: the arithmetic mean, the median, the geometric mean, the harmonic  mean,  the  variance,  the  standard  deviation,  the  median  absolute  deviation,  the  quantile,  the  interquartile  range,  the skewness, as well as the kurtosis. Evaluations using Monte-Carlo simulations show that standard errors estimators, assuming a normally  distributed  population,  are  almost  always  reliable.  In  addition,  as  expected,  smaller  sample  sizes  lead  to  less  reliable results.  The  only  exception  is  the  estimate  of  the  confidence  interval  for  kurtosis,  which  shows  evidence  of  unreliability.  We therefore propose an alternative measure of confidence interval based on the lognormal distribution. This review provides easy to find information about many descriptive statistics which can be used, for example, to plot error bars or confidence intervals.},

electric fields, and electric field gradients in a periodic computer simulation system of molecules
with charges, induced dipoles, and quadrupoles. The full expressions including quadrupolar
multipole interactions are given; those involving dipoles are included for completeness. The
expressions apply not only to molecules with permanent multipoles, but also to systems of
polarizable ions where the multipoles are induced by the interionic interactions. The expressions
which allow for this generalization consider the ions to be spherically polarizable, but include the
consequences of the coupling between dipolar and quadrupolar induction. The phonon dispersion
curves of MgO and the structural lattice constants of Al2O3 in its corundum phase are discussed as
specific examples. In simulations with a dipole- and quadrupole-polarizable interaction model, a full
Ewald summation of quadrupolar interactions is shown to have a significant effect.},
