## Case study 05 â€“ Nitrogen in PBC (bigger system) {#cs05}

A medium-sized system to test the novel SHAKE implementation.

Nitrogen parameters are taken from [this publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257635210_Short-Time_Oxidation_Behavior_of_Low-Carbon_Low-Silicon_Steel_in_Air_at_850-1180_C_II_Linear_to_Parabolic_Transition_Determined_Using_Existing_Gas-Phase_Transport_and_Solid-Phase_Diffusion_Theories).

Simulation results plotting methods are *echoed* at the end of the `cs05-run.sh` script. Measured quantities can be added directly to `.control` file.
