## Case study 04 â€“ Nitrogen in PBC {#cs04}

A simple system to test the novel SHAKE implementation.

Results supports the expected energy conservation orders of the methods as can be seen on the graph `eng_slope.eps`.

Nitrogen parameters are taken from [this publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257635210_Short-Time_Oxidation_Behavior_of_Low-Carbon_Low-Silicon_Steel_in_Air_at_850-1180_C_II_Linear_to_Parabolic_Transition_Determined_Using_Existing_Gas-Phase_Transport_and_Solid-Phase_Diffusion_Theories).
