## Case study 08 – Nitrogen in PBC for barostat tests {#cs08}

A simple system to test the NPT Nosé–Hoover (MTK) ensemble in the new universal scheme.

Nitrogen parameters are taken from [this publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257635210_Short-Time_Oxidation_Behavior_of_Low-Carbon_Low-Silicon_Steel_in_Air_at_850-1180_C_II_Linear_to_Parabolic_Transition_Determined_Using_Existing_Gas-Phase_Transport_and_Solid-Phase_Diffusion_Theories).

Currently trying to find out what is wrong with the total energy, whose fluctuations are far bigger than they should be (and than they are in DL POLY...).
Moreover the system is small so the LJ cutoff must be set very small → larger errors...
